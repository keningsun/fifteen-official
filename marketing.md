1. Brand positioning blocks

One-liner (pick one)
• Fifteen is an agentic workspace for VC research and investment memos.
• Fifteen turns scattered reading into structured conviction.
• Fifteen is a research OS without the “OS” vibe: documents, agents, and memory in one place.
• Fifteen is where diligence becomes a compounding asset.

Elevator pitch (2–3 sentences)
• Fifteen is an agentic workspace built for investors and research-heavy teams. Capture sources, draft memos with context-aware agents, and keep decisions traceable from first signal to IC. Less tab chaos, more conviction velocity.

“What we believe” (tone: calm, sharp)
• Research shouldn’t disappear into chat logs.
• Memos shouldn’t start from a blank page.
• Decision-making needs provenance, not vibes.
• The best teams compound knowledge, not just dealflow.

⸻

2. Taglines & slogans (short, reusable)
   • 15° off consensus.
   • From signal to memo.
   • Stop tab-hoarding. Start compounding.
   • Research that remembers.
   • Write with receipts.
   • Conviction, with provenance.
   • A workspace for long-cycle thinking.
   • Diligence, but faster.
   • Agentic notes. Real outputs.
   • Less searching. More deciding.

3. Bio / intro templates (social profiles)

Short bio (≤ 140 chars)
• Agentic workspace for VC research: capture sources, draft memos, keep decisions traceable.
• VC research + memos + agents. Build conviction with provenance.

Medium bio (2 lines)
• Fifteen is an agentic workspace for investors and research teams.
Capture, synthesize, and ship memos—without losing context.

Long bio (3–4 lines)
• Fifteen is built for research-heavy teams (VC, corp dev, strategy).
Turn reading + conversations into structured knowledge, draft memos with agent support, and keep every decision linkable to sources.
15° off consensus—on purpose.

4. Core feature blurbs (swap into landing pages / posts)

Feature: Capture
• Save sources fast—articles, PDFs, threads, notes—into a single research stream.
• Turn messy inputs into clean, searchable context.

Feature: Agentic drafting
• Draft investment memos with agents that stay grounded in your sources.
• Ask for comparisons, risk lists, counter-arguments, or a clean narrative—without losing the thread.

Feature: Traceability
• Every claim can point back to where it came from.
• Less “who said that?” more “here’s the source.”

Feature: Knowledge compounding
• Your team’s research shouldn’t reset every deal.
• Fifteen turns past work into a reusable edge.

⸻

5. Benefit-led bullets (choose 3–6 per post)
   • Cut time-to-memo by keeping sources + writing in one loop.
   • Reduce duplicated diligence across the team.
   • Make debates productive with shared context and receipts.
   • Improve decision quality by forcing clarity: thesis, risks, unknowns.
   • Onboard faster: new teammates learn from structured history.
   • Stay consistent: reusable memo structures and standard questions.

⸻

6. “Who it’s for” snippets

VC / investing
• For investors who read too much and still want clean outputs.
• For IC workflows: sourcing → diligence → memo → decision → follow-up.

Strategy / corp dev
• For teams tracking markets, competitors, and partnerships with long half-life knowledge.

Founder mode (if you want to include)
• For founders who need structured thinking, not more tools.

⸻

7. Differentiation lines (non-hype, sharp)
   • Not a chat app. Not a docs app. A workspace built around the memo loop.
   • AI isn’t a feature here—it’s a workflow layer on top of your research.
   • Most tools store notes. Fifteen stores decision context.
   • The goal isn’t “more content.” It’s faster conviction with fewer blind spots.

⸻

8. Objection-handling mini copy (FAQ-ready)

“Why not Notion/Docs + ChatGPT?”
• Because context gets lost. You end up copy-pasting and rebuilding the same logic every time. Fifteen keeps sources, reasoning, and outputs connected.

“Will agents hallucinate?”
• Fifteen’s workflow is designed to stay anchored to your sources and make it easy to check claims.

“Is this just for VCs?”
• Built for investing, but useful for any team doing high-volume reading → synthesis → decisions.

10. Post templates (official account / LinkedIn / X)

Template A: “Problem → Insight → Solution”
• Most research workflows fail at the same point: context breaks.
Sources live in tabs, notes live elsewhere, and the memo starts from scratch.
Fifteen keeps the loop closed—capture → synthesize → draft → decide, with traceable sources.

Template B: “15° off consensus” series opener
• 15° off consensus isn’t contrarian for sport.
It’s a reminder: the default narrative is rarely the full narrative.
Fifteen is built to help teams earn a non-consensus view—by making research structured, checkable, and reusable.

Template C: “Framework drop”
• A memo is just three things: 1. Thesis (what must be true) 2. Risks (what can break) 3. Proof (what we can verify)
Fifteen is designed around this loop—so your writing stays crisp and your debate stays grounded.

Template D: “Before/After”
• Before: 30 tabs, 5 docs, 2 chats, zero traceability.
After: one workspace where sources, synthesis, and the memo stay connected.
That’s the difference between “busy” and “compounding.”

⸻

11. Short ad-style copy (tight, punchy)
    • Turn reading into memos—fast.
    • Stop redoing diligence.
    • Agentic drafting, grounded in sources.
    • From signal to conviction.
    • Research that doesn’t forget.

⸻

12. Visual caption snippets (for screenshots / product UI images)
    • Draft with context.
    • Ask better questions.
    • Keep the receipts.
    • From notes to decisions.
    • Compounding research.

⸻

13. Tone guide (so it stays “official” but not cringe)
    • Prefer: clear, grounded, slightly sharp
    • Avoid: “revolutionary / game-changing / world-class / leading”
    • Use: verbs (capture, synthesize, draft, decide)
    • Keep sentences short. One idea per line.
